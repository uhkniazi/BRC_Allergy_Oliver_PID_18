**Diagnostic Model 1** utilised data collected for IgE sensitisation to each allergen (n=112) included in the ISAC microarray, across both PA (n=50) and PS (n=40) individuals. We used a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model where an adaptive prior using a variance hyper-parameter leads to shrinkage of regression coefficients.
